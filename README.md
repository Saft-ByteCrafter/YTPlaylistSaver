# YTPlaylistSaver
A tool to identify the title of videos from playlists, which have been taken down and thus are not accessable anymore.

### Installation:
There is no installer (yet?), just download both the .jar and the bat.-file, but them in a folder (any folder you want, as long as you don't need administrative 
permission to write there) and create a shortcut to the .bat in your windows startup directory.
You also could execute the .bat yourself every time or even execute the .jar directly, if you use the shortcut it is going to execute every time your PC starts up.
